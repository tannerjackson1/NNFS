Fashion MNIST Neural Network (From Scratch)

This project implements a fully connected neural network from scratch in pure Python, without using any external machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn. The architecture and training process follow the principles taught in Neural Networks from Scratch by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça.

The network achieves ~90% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
